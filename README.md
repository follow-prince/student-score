## Introductions

We are developing a student management webapp. For this purpose, we have named the app "Students Score" and incorporated additional features into the project. Some of the key features include the ability to add future events, important among them being exam results, exam timetables, today's schedule, college events notifications, crucial fee payment reminders, and a section for leave requests.
